# Refractive Index (RI) and Abbe number calculation by ML

RI and Abbe number for different composition of oxide glass are retrieved from glasspy hosted at https://github.com/drcassar/glasspy.
Glasspy is a python library that has a portion of sciglass database hosted at https://github.com/epam/SciGlass. 
Data is saved from glasspy colab notebook hosted at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MmghrTPGdt45u25XB5MsYU1-9UtwWAdP

ML Models are trained for predicting RI and Abbe number based on the composition as input.
96-97 % prediction accuracy is acheived for the testing sets.
